NOTE: attributes toggled by providing a value other than 0 will not work when the attribute type is "value_is_percentage"
the attribute is internally checked against the number 0, multiplying by 0 does nothing (learned this the hard way)

custom_uber_scales_damage (checked against weapon):
	when added to a weapon, scales damage dealt with the weapon
	from 10% to 100% based on the player's ubercharge level

		enabled with any non-zero value
	
custom_rocket_homing (checked against weapon):
	enables the player to toggle half-life 2 style rocket tracking
	with the m2 button. currently only works weapons that fire the soldier's rockets

custom_dispenser_type (globally checked):
custom_teleporter_type (globally checked):

		buildings default to 0 when no override is present
		sentry:
			0: normal
			1: mini
			2: artillery
			3: lucycharm
		dispenser:
			0: normal
			1: mini
			2: nothing yet
			3: nothing yet
